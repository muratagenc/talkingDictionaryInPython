# talkingDictionaryInPython
created for Ubuntu but obviously works under any O.S. with Python 3 installed.

a Python script that downloads mp3 file of an English word, prints its meaning on terminal

Requires Internet connection

I created this small app to query words while reading PDF text-books on my desktop computer.

It downloads mp3 files and stores in ./data folder. If the file is already in, it doesn't use the Internet for it.
this version gets definitions from Meriam Webster dictionary web site and does not save them as text files.

I may work on it later to save definitions too.

data.zip includes all the word mp3 files I have and will be updated frequently.
